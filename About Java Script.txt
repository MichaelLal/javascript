About Java Script 
Java script is the programming language of the web. it iis used to calculate manipulated and validate data.

The <script> tag
in Html, javaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script>
JavaScript in <head> or <body>
You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.

JavaScript Syntax
Syntax Rules
Syntax are the rules how programs must be constructed:
// How to Declare variables:
let x = 5;
let y = 6;

// How to Compute values:
let z = x + y;

// I am a Comment. I do Nothing

JavaScript Literals
The most important syntax rules for literals (fixed values) are:

Numbers are written with or without decimals:

Example
10.50
1001

JavaScript Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.

Variables must be identified with unique names.

Example
// Define x as a variable
let x;

// Assign the value 6 to x
x = 6;

JavaScript is Case Sensitive
JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive.

The variables lastName and lastname, are different variables:

Example
let lastName = "Doe";
let lastname = "Peterson";

JavaScript Keywords
JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

Our Reserved Words Reference lists all JavaScript keywords.

Here is a list of some of the keywords you will learn about in this tutorial:

Keyword	Description
var	        ||  Declares a variable
let	        ||  Declares a block variable
const       ||	Declares a block constant
if          ||	Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition
switch      !!	Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases
for         ||	Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop
function    ||	Declares a function
return      ||	Exits a function
try         ||	Implements error handling to a block of statements

JavaScript Comments
Single Line Comments
Single line comments start with //.

Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

JavaScript Data Types
JavaScript variables can hold 8 datatypes, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.

Strings are text written inside quotes.

Numbers are written without quotes.

If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.

Example
const pi = 3.14;
let person = "John Doe";
let answer = 'Yes I am!';

One Statement, Many Variables
You can declare many variables in one statement.

Start the statement with let or constand separate the variables by comma:

Example
let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;

The typeof Operator
You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable.

The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression:

Example
typeof ""             // Returns "string"
typeof "John"         // Returns "string"
typeof "John Doe"     // Returns "string"

JavaScript has 8 Datatypes
A JavaScript variable can hold 8 types of data:

Type	Description
String	    ||  A text of characters enclosed in quotes
Number	    ||  A number representing a mathematical value
Bigint	    ||  A number representing a large integer
Boolean     ||	A data type representing true or false
Object      ||	A collection of key-value pairs of data
Undefined   ||	A primitive variable with no assigned value
Null        ||	A primitive value representing object absence
Symbol      ||	A unique and primitive identifier

Examples
// String
let color = "Yellow";
let lastName = "Johnson";

// Number
let length = 16;
let weight = 7.5;

// BigInt
let x = 1234567890123456789012345n;
let y = BigInt(1234567890123456789012345)

// Boolean
let x = true;
let y = false;

// Object
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};

// Array object
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

// Date object
const date = new Date("2022-03-25");

// Undefined
let x;
let y;

// Null
let x = null;
let y = null;

// Symbol
const x = Symbol();
const y = Symbol();

JavaScript Booleans
JavaScript booleans can only have one of two values: true or false
The boolean value of an expression is the basis for JavaScript comparisons.
Given that x = 5, the table below explains comparison:
Description	    Expression	Returns
Equal to	    ||(x == 8)	||false
Not equal to	||(x != 8)	||true
Greater than	||(x > 8)	||false
Less than	    ||(x < 8)	||true

Java Operator
Operator	Description
+       ||  Addition
-	    ||  Subtraction
*	    ||  Multiplication
**	    ||  Exponentiation
/	    ||  Division
%	    ||  Modulus (Division Remainder)
++	    ||  Increment
--	    ||  Decrement

JavaScript Logical Operators
Operator	Description
&&	    ||  logical and
||	    ||  logical or
!	    ||  logical not

Conditional Statements
Conditional Statements allow us to perform different actions for different conditions.

Conditional statements run different code depending on true or false conditions.

Conditional statements include:

if
if...else
if...else if...else
switch
ternary (? :)
When to use Conditionals
Use if to specify a code block to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a code block to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative code blocks to be executed
Use (? :) (ternary) as a shorthand for if...else

The else Statement
Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if a condition is false.

if (condition) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}

Switch Control Flow
Based on a condition, switch selects one or more code blocks to be executed.

switch executes the code blocks that matches an expression.

switch is often used as a more readable alternative to many if...else if...else statements, especially when dealing with multiple possible values.

Syntax
switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}
Example
This example uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:

switch (new Date().getDay()) {
  case 0:
    day = "Sunday";
    break;
  case 1:
    day = "Monday";
    break;
  case 2:
     day = "Tuesday";
    break;
  case 3:
    day = "Wednesday";
    break;
  case 4:
    day = "Thursday";
    break;
  case 5:
    day = "Friday";
    break;
  case 6:
    day = "Saturday";
}
The Boolean Data Type
In JavaScript, a Boolean is a primitive data type that can only have one of two values:

true or false

The Boolean value of an expression is the basis for all JavaScript comparisons and conditions.
The For Loop
The for statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions:

for (exp 1; exp 2; exp 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
exp 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

exp 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

exp 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

While Loops
While loops execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

JavaScript have two types of while loops:

The while loop
The do while loop

The Do While Loop
The do while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

Syntax
do {
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);

JavaScript String includes()
The includes() method returns true if a string contains a specified value.

Otherwise it returns false.

Examples
Check if a string includes "world":

let text = "Hello world, welcome to the universe.";
text.includes("world");
